			<h1> History of the Tunnels</h1> <hr/>
			<p> The Shanghai tunnels<b> are said to be one of the most haunted places in 
			America. Shanghaiing<b> was a common practice in the city where people where
			used as slaves to perform various types of work. The area was originally for
			businesses such as bars and restaurants. The tunnels were connected to the 
			basements of these structures to acquire the supplies that came in. Trap door 
			systems were soon developed by the individuals who practiced Shanghaiing. 
			Drugs or alcohol was used to subdue men and women so that by the time they 
			woke up, it would be too late to go back. It is believed that nearly two
			thousand individuals were brought into the tunnels and there have been reports 
			of paranormal activity<b> as a result of the emotional energy that took 
			place.</p>
